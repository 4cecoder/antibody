Antibody is faster than other zsh package managers, but you might want to speed it up further.

Highly recommended to read the following.

Here's some useful links:
 - [Speeding up my ZSH load - Carlos Alexandro Becker](https://carlosbecker.com/posts/speeding-up-zsh/): outlines a few fixes that will speed up the prompt massively. Also explains how to debug your prompt load time.
 - [Speed up zsh compinit by only checking cache once a day.](https://gist.github.com/ctechols/ca1035271ad134841284): mentioned in the previous link, but leaving this here for reference as it is helpful for anyone using zsh.
